# DAO Gallery (MVP)

The DAO Gallery is a prototype of a decentralized art gallery in which
ownership of physical works of art is tokenized using NFT,
and key decisions (exhibitions, cities, expositions) are made collectively
by the participants of the DAO.

The project is implemented as an MVP and focuses on business logic, data, and analytics
rather than the user interface.

## Project idea

The DAO Gallery acts as a foundation that:

- stores physical paintings;
- releases NFTs corresponding to each painting;
- provides a marketplace for trading these NFTs;
- charges a commission on each transaction;
- organizes offline exhibitions in different cities;
- allows the DAO participants to vote on the choice of paintings and locations.

Owning an NFT means owning the corresponding physical painting.
